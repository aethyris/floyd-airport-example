# Floyd Algorithm Example

This is an example of the Floyd Algorithm, used to find the shortest distance between multiple nodes in a directed graph. In this case, the algorithm is used to find the shortest path between different airports.

The airports or vertices of the graph are found in the file `test_nodes.csv`, while the edges of the graph are located in `test_edges.csv`.

# Instructions

Run `app.py`. A command-line menu will give you the option to list the airports in the graph or find the shortest path between two airports.
